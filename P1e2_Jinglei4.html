  <h6><p><em>People used to carefully read my posts</p><p> and leave lots of relevant comments,</p><p> and even many of those who strongly disagreed with</p><p> me still came to read. Other blogs</p><p> linked to mine to discuss what I was</p><p>saying. I felt like a king.</em></p></h6>
  <h1><p>Blogs were gold and bloggers were rock stars</p> <p>back in <sub>2</sub><sup>0</sup><sup><sup>0</sup></sup><sub>8</sub> when I was arrested. At that</p><p> point, and despite the fact the state was blocking</p><p>access to my blog from inside Iran, I had an</p><p> audience of around <sup><sup>2</sup></sup><sub><sub>0</sub></sub>,<sub>0</sub><sup><sup>0</sup></sup><sup>0</sup> people every day.</p><p> Everybody I linked to would face a sudden</p><p> and serious jump in traffic: I could empower</p><p> or embarrass anyone I wanted.</p></h1>
  <h5><p><u>The iPhone was a little over a year old by then, </p><p>but smartphones were still mostly used to make phone</p><p>calls and send short messages, handle emails,</p><p> and surf the web. There were no real apps,</p><p> certainly not how we think of them today. There</p><p> was no Instagram, no SnapChat, no Viber, no WhatsApp.</p><p>Instead, there was the web, and on the web,</p><p> there were blogs: the best place to find alternative</p><p> thoughts, news and analysis. They were my life.</u></p><h5>
  <h2><p>It had all started with 9/11.</p><p> I was in Toronto, and my father had</p><p> just arrived from Tehran for a visit.</p><p> We were having breakfast when the second</p><p> plane hit the World Trade Center.</p><p> I was puzzled and confused and, looking</p><p> for insights and explanations, I </p><p>came across blogs. Once I read</p><p> a few, I thought: This is it,</p><p> I should start one, and encourage all</p><p>Iranians to start blogging as well.</p><p> So, using Notepad on Windows,</p><p> I started experimenting. Soon</p><p> I ended up writing on hoder.com, </p><p>using Blogger’s publishing platform</p><p> before Google bought it.</p></h2>
  <h3><p>Then, on November <em>5, 2001,</em> I published a step-to-step</p><p> guide on how to start a blog. That sparked something</p><p> that was later called a blogging revolution: Soon, </p><p>hundreds and thousands of Iranians made it one of the </p><p>top 5 nations by the number of blogs, and I was proud</p><p> to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing.</p></h3>
  <h4><p><u>Those days, I used to keep a list of all blogs</p><p> in Persian and, for a while, I was the</p><p> first person any new blogger in Iran would contact,</p><p> so they could get on the list. That’s why they </p><p>called me “the blogfather” in my mid-twenties — it</p><p> was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I cared.</u></p></h4>
