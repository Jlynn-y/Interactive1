  <h1><p>Blogs were gold</p><p>and bloggers were rock stars</p><p> back in 2008 </p><p>when I was arrested.</p></h1>
  <h6><p>At that point, and despite the fact the state was blocking access to my blog from inside Iran,</p><p> I had an audience of around 20,000 people every day. Everybody I linked to would face</p><p> a sudden and serious jump in traffic: I could empower or embarrass anyone I wanted.</p>People used to carefully read my posts and leave lots of relevant comments, and even</p><p> many of those who strongly disagreed with me still came to read. Other blogs linked </p><p>to mine to discuss what I was saying. I felt like a king.</p></h6>
  <h2><p>The iPhone was a little over a year old by then, </p><p>but smartphones were still mostly used to make </p><p>phone calls and send short messages, handle emails, and surf the web.</p></h2>
  <h6><p>There were no real apps, certainly not how we think of them today. There was</p><p> no Instagram, no SnapChat, no Viber, no WhatsApp. Instead, there was the web,</p><p> and on the web, there were blogs: the best place to find alternative thoughts,</p><p> news and analysis. They were my life.</p></h6>
  <h2>It had all started with 9/11. I was in Toronto, <p>and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a visit.</p></h2>
<h5>We were having breakfast when the second plane hit the World Trade Center. I was puzzled and confused and, looking for insights and explanations, I came across blogs. Once I read a few, I thought: This is it, I should start one, and encourage all Iranians to start blogging as well. So, using Notepad on Windows, I started experimenting. Soon I ended up writing on hoder.com, using Blogger’s publishing platform before Google bought it.
Then, on November 5, 2001, I published a step-to-step guide on how to start a blog. That sparked something that was later called a blogging revolution: Soon, hundreds and thousands of Iranians made it one of the top 5 nations by the number of blogs, and I was proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing.
Those days, I used to keep a list of all blogs in Persian and, for a while, I was the first person any new blogger in Iran would contact, so they could get on the list. That’s why they called me “the blogfather” in my mid-twenties — it was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I cared.</h5>
